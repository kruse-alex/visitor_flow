# Analyzing visitor flows with Google’s chart tool in R
Let’s say you have a website or an app and you would like to know how your visitors navigate through it. I came across the googleVis package to solve this task. It provides you with an interface to Google’s chart tools and lets you create interactive charts based on data frames. In this package you will find a function to create sankey diagrams, which are a specific type of flow diagram. Usally the weight of an arrow is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.
